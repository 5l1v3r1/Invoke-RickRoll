This is a modified Rick Roll ASCII Troll for Powershell  
The original code for Invoke-RickRoll was taken from Lee Holmes. His Version can be found here: http://www.leeholmes.com/projects/ps_html5/Invoke-PSHtml5.ps1  
This version has all the ASCII data already in the ps1 script so there isn't a need to download it from the website like it other implementations.  
This version does not have audio because that relied on downloading the mp3 from the internet.  
The purpose of this version was to make this troll work without internet.  

The Invoke-RickRoll file is the powershell script.  
The loop.bat file allows the script to be called in a loop.  
The hidden.vbs file calls the batch file, allowing the script to run in the background with no CMD window appearing (other than the Rick Rolled Powershell windows).
